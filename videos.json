          "description": "The life we live online increasingly informs the way we live offline as well. Businesses live and die through algorithms like SEO, humans are sorted in government systems, and we make large, life-governing decisions through what is shown to us on the web: home buying, where to live, what to eat, and who we're in contact with regularly. The first shift we as web developers saw was people living and learning on the web more and more, which excited us. But as we start to automate those tasks through machine learning algorithms, a lot of us have trepidation. We know systems have flaws, what are the political and social consequences?\n\nIn this talk we'll explore this paradigm shift and some of it's dangers, but we'll also talk about the good impacts technology can bring. Helping people who need it, automating tasks for humans with disabilities, communication for emergency services: the possibilities for positive influence are endless. We'll explore just some of the tools that are out there, how with a little creativity, we can use these technologies for good. We as developers have a voice and chance to make a difference.",

Users often come to your docs when they are frustrated with your software, disappointed that they haven't been able to solve the problem on their own and generally feeling pretty low. This is a little sad, yeah, but being aware of these feelings is key for developers and technical writers. These emotions frame the reader‚Äôs perspective and therefore, should shape the mood of our docs. After all, when you've been stuck on a bug for hours, do you really want to read something saying 'but this is so easy'?

          "description": "In 2017, Airbnb supported 27 languages and had developed robust translation tools that made it easy to add more. We launched Croatian in May with little overhead beyond setting up the new domain and translating phrases. However, this was not true for all new languages; our next most requested language, Hebrew, posed a unique challenge. Because it reads right-to-left, the entire Hebrew UI must be flipped. Browsers only handle reversing the DOM structure, but styling and interactions must be coded manually.\n\nThis talk covers the journey of enabling right-to-left languages on airbnb.com. Recently, Airbnb has moved to a React frontend and away from Sass to a CSS-in-JS paradigm. We developed a performant and cross-browser solution for RTL that leveraged a CSS-in-JS abstraction layer to isolate the logic from our codebase. Our efforts led us most of the way to launching in Arabic and Hebrew while requiring little effort from our product engineers and with minimal disruption to their work.",

          "description": "We are in a consequential shift in design as it relates to human-computer interaction. Design, at its core, has never been primarily about creating objects; it is fundamentally about solving problems. Aesthetic and functional forms and patterns‚Äîbe they visual, cognitive, or tangible‚Äîare the product of problem solving. One of the most formidable problems that we will face when designing user interfaces in the emerging paradigm of ubiquitous computing, is how to manage the limited bandwidth of user attention.\n\nThis talk will address the need to extrapolate new models and metaphors of interaction in order to manage the burgeoning volume of features and signals in the software that mediates so much of our lives. In this world, user interfaces must become more transparent and unobtrusive. This means that they will need to do more than simply present features and information, they will also need to be able to know when to hide these things from us as well. Interfaces will have to be designed to proactively think ahead of us, and anticipate what we need before we need it.",

React popularized the Virtual DOM rendering model, Flux did the same with unidirectional data flow, and now The Elm Architecture is opening new frontiers like reliable time travel and managed effects.\n\nWhat benefits do we gain when transitioning from one architecture to another? What does it cost us? This talk explores the tradeoffs between old-school jQuery, modern-day Flux, and cutting-edge Elm Architecture in the browser.",

The '60s and early '70s were a fertile time for CS ideas, reminds Victor, but even more importantly, it was a time of unfettered thinking, unconstrained by programming dogma, authority, and tradition. 'The most dangerous thought that you can have as a creative person is to think that you know what you're doing,' explains Victor. 'Because once you think you know what you're doing you stop looking around for other ways of doing things and you stop being able to see other ways of doing things. You become blind.' He concludes, 'I think you have to say: \"We don't know what programming is. We don't know what computing is. We don't even know what a computer is.\" And once you truly understand that, and once you truly believe that, then you're free, and you can think anything.'",

Ever fixed that bug by wrapping a section of code in a setTimeout? Ever found that fix to be unreliable, and played around with the timeout number until it kinda almost always worked? \nThis talk looks at the browser's event loop, the thing that orchestrates the main thread of the browser, which includes JavaScript, events, and rendering. We'll look at the difference between tasks, microtasks, requestAnimationFrame, requestIdleCallback, and where events land. \nHopefully you'll never have to use setTimeout hacks again!\"",

          "description": "Javascript has always been a language with very little syntactic sugar‚Äîfor better or worse. With ES6/2015, and future iterations,though, Javascript is gaining a more and more abstract and expressive syntax. To some it might appear that our language‚Äîwhich already seems accessible and approachable for beginners‚Äîis becoming even more accessible and approachable. However, both the humanities and CS education research have proven that abstraction, while a powerful tool for knowledgeable practitioners, can be an equally powerful foil for beginners.\n\nAs we enter the era of language-level abstractions in ES6/2015, we are charged with the task of rethinking how we teach JavaScript. Through an interdisciplinary montage I will identify the problem of teaching abstraction as a ubiquitous demand across nearly every domain, and align the issues of creativity and critical thinking in the humanities with issues in computer science.\n\nThe talk will conclude with a discussion of how the discipline of computer science and that of the humanities can inform each other to produce more effective and creative solutions to both developing and teaching abstractions.",

          "description": "25 years ago I published \"Why Functional Programming Matters\", a manifesto for FP--but the subject is much older than that!\n\nAs software becomes more and more complex, it is more and more important to structure it well. Well-structured software is easy to write, easy to debug, and provides a collection of modules that can be re-used to reduce future programming costs. Conventional languages place conceptual limits on the way problems can be modularised. Functional languages push those limits back. In this paper we show that two features of functional languages in particular, higher-order functions and lazy evaluation, can contribute greatly to modularity. As examples, we manipulate lists and trees, program several numerical algorithms, and implement the alpha-beta heuristic (an algorithm from Artificial Intelligence used in game-playing programs). Since modularity is the key to successful programming, functional languages are vitally important to the real world.\n\nIn this talk we'll take a deep dive into history to revisit our personal selection of highlights.",

That‚Äôs a huge responsibiliy that can be amazing, only if you wonder ‚Äúwhat do I want to create, and not to create?‚Äù\n\nWe are designers because we love to create, but creation without responsibility breeds destruction. Every day, designers all over the world work on projects without giving any thought or consideration to the impact that work has on the world around them. This attitude leads to destruction, and this needs to change.\nTo illustrate its talk, Mike Monteiro use the exemple of broken lifes because of a change in Facebook Confidentiality Parameters. For Mike Monteiro, every designers should wonder what are the consequences of their job : ‚Äúbe more scared of your work‚Äôs consequences than you love the smartness of your own ideas‚Äù.",

We do not see it; we do not talk about it.\n\nWe feel awkward when people are stressed or come back from sick leave. We try not to talk about it. It is so much easier with a broken leg; we can carry stuff for them, hold the door, get coffee etc., but what do we do with a person with stress?\n\nI have been sick with stress and it took nine months to come back. It was the second time and it had to hit me hard before I took it seriously.\n\nI believe strongly in taking openly about stress and depression. It is the only way we can learn from it; the way we can make it okay to say ‚ÄúI need help!‚Äù.\n\nIn this talk I will discuss the taboo and explore why it hits knowledge workers so often, as well as come with tips and trick to prevent it.",

          "description": "Developers can get better at their craft by learning from the great writers who mastered theirs. Writing software isn‚Äôt the same as writing a novel, but there are parallels. Besides, advice from writers is better because writers have been struggling with their craft for many centuries, not just a few decades. It‚Äôs better-written as well. This talk shares great writers‚Äô best advice for coders: Stephen King on refactoring, Anne Rice on development hardware, Hemingway on modelling with personas, and Neil Gaiman on everything. This session first explores the similarities between writing and coding, and uses writers‚Äô advice to identify different kinds of avoidable bad naming in code. Some class, method, and variable names are so bad that they‚Äôre funny, but you‚Äôve still seen them in production code. The second part of the session explores practical techniques for working on better naming, including renaming things. Renaming is even harder because it includes naming things plus other hard things. The final section goes back to writing. The next step after finding better names in code is to write better comments in code, which is almost as hard as naming is. The surprising thing about naming things well in code is not that it‚Äôs hard, but how easy it is to accept bad names. This is a hard problem that‚Äôs worth working on, because although you can‚Äôt make the naming problem go away, you can learn to write much better code regardless of which technologies you use.",

          "description": "To this day most people who set out to help others learn C++ start with \"introduction to C\" material. I think this actively contributes to bad C++ code in the world. For the past few years I've been teaching C++ (and making suggestions to folks who intend to teach themselves) in an entirely different way. No char* strings, no strlen, strcmp, strcpy, no printf, and no [] arrays. Pointers introduced very late. References before pointers, and polymorphism with references rather than with pointers. Smart pointers as the default pointer with raw pointers (whether from new or &) reserved for times they're needed. Drawing on the Standard Library sooner rather than later, and writing modern C++ from lesson 1.\n\nIn this session I want to talk about the specific advantages of teaching C++ this way ‚Äì a way that‚Äôs very different from the way you almost certainly learned the language. You‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised to see what you get to leave for later or never cover at all, what bad habits you don't later need to correct, what complicated concepts actually become accessible to beginners, and how you spend a lot less time dictating magic spells you can't explain yet, and more showing someone a comprehensive, sensible, and understandable language.\n\nYou don't have to be a trainer to come to this session. If you ever mentor other developers and show them your C++ code, if you ever help somebody choose a book or a course or other material to learn from, or even if you occasionally feel bad that you work in a language that's hard to learn, come and see how one philosophical shift can turn that very same language into one that's actually pretty easy to learn!",

Many people aren't sure, but it's not just uncertainty: risk is exposure to uncertainty.\n\nInstead of just plastering over the cracks, security should also involve reducing the size and number of cracks, reducing the opportunities for cracks to appear, reducing the class of errors and oversights that can open a system to failure instigated from the outside. We can learn a lot from other kinds of software failure, because every failure unrelated to security can be easily reframed as a security-failure opportunity.\n\nThis is not a talk about access control models, authentication, encryption standards, firewalls, etc. This is a talk about reducing risk that lives in the code and the assumptions of architecture, reducing the risk in development practices and in the blind spot of development practices.",

On July 20, 1969 a whole generation of Americans had one of those transforming experiences: Two men landed on the Moon and nothing was ever the same again. Why did we go to the Moon? How did we get there? What was it like to witness it all? And what does any of this have to do with writing software 40 years later? In this talk, Russ Olsen will take you back to a humid Sunday afternoon that changed his life. It might yet change yours.\n\nRuss likes to think that the technology is there to solve problems for people, not the other way around.\n\nRuss started his career doing that other kind of engineering, the sort that involves electricity, gears and getting dirty. Pretty rapidly the wonder of computer programming lured Russ away, which probably explains why most of his fingers are still intact today.\n\nSince turning to coding, Russ has worked on everything from 3D design and image processing software to database query engines and workflow systems. Russ first discovered Ruby back in 2000 when he went looking for a simple programming language to teach to his son. The seven year old lost interest, but Russ never did and he has been building increasingly sophisticated systems in Ruby ever since.",

Imagine drawing a grid in the browser and placing content in one or any number of cells without having to change the HTML or source order. And imagine changing that grid on the fly using media queries or JavaScript while keeping the HTML markup clean and accessible. That‚Äôs what CSS Grid does, and that‚Äôs why you should be using it today.\nThe CSS Grid Layout Module introduces a native CSS grid system, provided at the viewport level, that achieves what CSS frameworks and popular grid systems could only dream about: Responsive, flexible, pure CSS grid layouts, independent of document source order, that allow us to treat the browser as a true design and layout surface.\nIn this talk you‚Äôll get an intro to CSS Grid and learn how it changes pretty much everything when it comes to layouts on the web. Through examples, code snippets, and practical demos you‚Äôll learn how to use CSS Grid in a theme for modern responsive layouts, and you‚Äôll also learn how to handle older browsers without Grid support in a clean and straight-forward way.\nCSS Grid is here, and you can start using it today. This talk shows you how to do it right.",

With ReasonML, you take everything you love about building applications for the web. Add types for safety and a world class compiler that doesn't require you to write type declarations for every expression but just infers the types through the program.\n\nLearn how to build a universally rendered ReactJS application in ReasonML, on both the front and the backend.

You see, people with disabilities gain privacy and independence when they can handle their own affairs. Wouldn't it be radical if every web application supported users with disabilities?\n\nAs web experts, we can enable more of our users by shipping accessible interfaces every time, and I'll show you how. In this talk, We'll audit a web application for accessibility, making the necessary changes to support people with disabilities. The best part about it? By integrating accessibility into our development workflow, we'll make our apps more usable by everyone.",

The Knuth quote about \"premature optimization\" either tells us that optimization is always bad, or bad 97% of the time, depending on how much of the quote we bothered to read.\n\nNone of these prescriptions describe a context in which they might not apply.  Taken literally, most are wildly misleading.  To use them properly, we must already have a nuanced understanding of software.\n\nThis talk presents a framework to intuit these same insights, but also their boundaries.  It provides concepts and vocabulary that enable the viewer to not only explain how a problem should be solved, but why.",

        "description": "The case for Progressive Web\n\nThe mobile web is slow and we've become accustomed to developing large and complex applications with powerful desktop and laptop machines. 73% of mobile internet users say that they‚Äôve encountered a website that was too slow to load. The world of front end development is evolving continuously with more client-side heavy applications and with this, bundle sizes for many JS frameworks can be huge. This can significantly affect loading times, especially on a mobile device with a poor connection.\n\nPRPL Pattern\n\nThis talk will cover the concept behind the PRPL pattern, what it is and how you can use it to build a fast and reliable progressive single-page application.\n\nWe‚Äôll talk about how you can:\n\n* Push the most important resources first\n* Render your initial route as soon as possible\n* Pre-cache resources for all your routes using a Service Worker\n* Lazy load your remaining routes so that they load on demand",

Formik adds a level of organization to your forms that allows for easier implementation, integrated validation, and a consistent interface to add third party components.  Formik also makes it easy to abstract common form behavior into primitives that you can share and compose throughout your application. Watch as Jared Palmer walks us through some common form problems and the solutions that Formik provides.",

Aiming to fill this void, Razzle is a tool that abstracts all the complex configuration needed for SSR into a single dependency--giving you the developer experience of create-react-app, but then leaving the rest of your app's architectural decisions about frameworks, routing, and data fetching up to you. With this approach, Razzle not only works with React, but also Reason, Elm, Vue, Angular, and most importantly... whatever comes next.",

With ideas from cognitive science, education, and some advice from admired programmers along the way, we are going to explore what it means to be a world-class developer and what we need to do to get there. I'll talk a little bit about the philosophy, attitude, and habits (both good and bad) required for learning how to learn better, and then we will talk about the kinds of skills and knowledge that an expert programmer in general needs. Along the way we'll touch about various myths and cognitive biases about who can and cannot be a great programmer, and leave you with a path to get started. By the end of the talk, I will have proposed a curriculum of topics that should take an intermediate developer and turn them into an advanced one, and special attention will be given to mastery of the JavaScript language.",

So knitting is inherently binary, and that opens up a world of possibilities for a coder.\n\nKnitted fabric can be used to encode data in a number of ways, from QR code mittens to a fluffy red virus scarf. Patterns themselves become algorithms, and new syntax proposals allow for automated testing, compilers, and even visualisers. Crafters and programmers are working together in the burgeoning Maker scene to hack hardware, create innovative e-textiles, and push the computational limits of sticks and string.\n\nIn this Software Art Thou talk, developer and knitting enthusiast Kris Howard shows how knitting can make you a better coder.",

Can we push the language into the academic field so that students are better prepared for the jobs of the future in IT? \n\nI want to make a case here, that JavaScript forces you to go one step further in understanding what you are doing, compared with other mainstream languages that have their abstractions already built into the language. We will look at a few common patterns to establish some context and we will discuss about the dangers of abstractions and the source of the JavaScript Fatigue‚Ñ¢.",

And it came with a serious use case, too: The slogan of the vibrator was \"Let him control you\", which I found very limiting, so I used the Web Bluetooth API to connect it to the browser, and the Web Audio API, to establish my own slogan: \"Let a video control you\". In my talk you will learn how to use the Web Bluetooth API to connect a Bluetooth enabled device to the browser.

Yet there are still many open source maintainers struggling on the verge of burnout while their software is being used by millions. So in this talk I will share with you my journey of open source - in particular how I made it my full-time job - in the hope of shedding some insights on open source sustainability.",

Symptoms included sweaty palms and recurring nightmares with blood-thirsty ASCII symbols. But don't worry, this condition doesn't have to be chronic. A cure is right around the corner.\n\nAs with many developers, you're familiar with the power of regular expressions, but anything beyond the basics scares the crap out of you. Fear no more young padawan! In this talk, we'll start with the basics and progressively enhance your knowledge until you're coding regular expressions like a champ. Everything will be demonstrated live with visual examples that ensure maximum comprehension.",

What does it look like in practice? And which consequences does this have for our work on software today?\n\nThis talk by Lena Reinhard takes you on a journey from the early days of computing, to debugging, to the technology industry, to our roles in all of this. It shows why we need to care about the social and ethical implications of our work, and highlights ways for us to approach these topics ‚Äì by ourselves, and together with the people we work with. This talk wants to encourage you to think about your own role, your power, and your responsibilities as a person working on technology.

        "description": "Statically typed functional programming languages encourage a very different way of thinking about types. The type system is your friend, not an annoyance, and can be used in many ways that might not be familiar to OO programmers.\nTypes can be used to represent the domain in a fine-grained, self documenting way. And in many cases, types can even be used to encode business rules so that you literally cannot create incorrect code. You can then use the static type checking almost as an instant unit test ‚Äî making sure that your code is correct at compile time.\n\nIn this talk, we'll look at some of the ways you can use types as part of a domain driven design process, with some simple real world examples in F#. No jargon, no maths, and no prior F# experience necessary.",
